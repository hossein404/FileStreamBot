-   **High-Speed Streaming**: Links are generated on the fly without downloading files to your server first.
-   **Secure & Persistent Web Admin Panel**: Manage users and view statistics through a simple and secure web interface with password hashing, CSRF protection, and persistent sessions via Redis.
-   **Secure**: Restrict access to authorized users and specific channels.
-   **Easy to Deploy**: Get your bot up and running with just a few simple commands.

## üîß Installation & Deployment

Follow these steps to deploy the bot:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hossein404/FileStreamBot.git
    cd FileStreamBot
    ```

2.  **Install Prerequisites (Redis):**
    This project requires Redis for persistent admin sessions. Install it on your server.
    ```bash
    # For Debian/Ubuntu
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install redis-server -y
    sudo systemctl enable redis-server.service
    ```

3.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv ./venv
    source ./venv/bin/activate
    ```
    *(On Windows, use `.\venv\Scripts\activate`)*

4.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file by copying the structure below and fill in your details.

    ```ini
    # Get this from my.telegram.org
    API_ID=
    API_HASH=

    # Get this from @BotFather
    BOT_TOKEN=

    # This is a channel ID for storing files. The bot must be an admin in this channel.
    # It can be a public or private channel. For private channels, use its negative ID (e.g., -100123456789).
    BIN_CHANNEL=

    # Your Telegram user ID. The bot will recognize you as the owner.
    OWNER_ID=

    # The port on which the web server will listen. Default is 8080.
    PORT=

    # Your server's public IP address or a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).
    FQDN=

    # Set to "true" if you are using SSL/TLS (HTTPS), otherwise "false".
    HAS_SSL=

    # Set to "true" to save pyrogram session files.
    USE_SESSION_FILE=

    # Credentials for the web admin panel.
    ADMIN_USERNAME=
    ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH= # Generate this in the next step

    # Redis URL for persistent admin sessions
    REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
    ```

6.  **Set Admin Password (Securely):**
    Run the included script to generate a secure hash for your desired password.
    ```bash
    python3 generate_hash.py
    ```
    Enter your password when prompted. The script will output a hashed string. Copy this entire string and paste it as the value for `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` in your `.env` file.

7.  **Run the bot:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m WebStreamer
    ```

Your bot is now live and ready to serve!

## üåê Web Panel Usage

-   **Access**: You can access the admin panel by navigating to `http://<Your_FQDN>:<PORT>/admin/login` in your web browser.
-   **Login**: Use the `ADMIN_USERNAME` and the password you set in **Step 6** to log in. Your session will now persist even if the bot restarts.
-   **Features**: From the dashboard, you can view bot statistics, manage users (add/remove), and perform other administrative tasks.
